Discover why they’re valuable and see examples to help you write your own effective bullet points.\nIn this age of non-stop online stimulation, capturing and keeping attention is crucial for marketers. Grabbing and holding the attention of your audience can make or break your ability to bring awareness to your brand.\nBullet points offer readers the brevity they want without sacrificing value. To achieve this, your bullet points should be high-impact statements about your content.\nIn this article, we’ll share ways you can use bullet points to make your content more appealing to readers while keeping their attention. We’ll also highlight an important tool to help you write persuasive bullet points.\nNumbered Lists vs. Bulleted Lists Generally, there are two forms of lists — numbered lists and bulleted lists. Here are some tips for using each option effectively.\nWhen Numbered Lists Are Better A numbered list is introduced with a numerical value. These lists are best used when the order of the items matters, such as steps in a process.\nNumbered lists might be used for any of the following reasons:\nCreating a top 10 list Writing a step-by-step guide Listing hypotheses Here’s how a numbered list would work in a step-by-step guide for washing a car:\nPrepare two buckets of water with a cleaning solution and a spare cloth. Park your car in an open space where you can reach all sides. Rinse the car with clean water to remove any loose dirt or mud. Dip the cloth in the cleaning solution and use it to wipe the car down, from top to bottom. Rinse the car again with clean water to remove all the cleaning solution. Wax your car for added shine and luxury. When Bulleted Lists Win We use bullet lists when the order of the points doesn’t matter. These lists begin with a special character, commonly dots.\nThe benefits of bulleted lists include:\nSharing content efficiently: Simplifying content gets your point across faster. Improving readability: Readers enjoy content more when it is easy to skim and read. Drawing attention to key information: Readers grasp valuable information more quickly. Sharing content efficiently:\nImproving readability:\nDrawing attention to key information:\nHow to Write Powerful Bullet Points Writing strong bullet points doesn’t have to be a mystery. Here’s what you need to know to write bulleted lists that keep readers interested:\n1. Keep Bullet Points Symmetrical Make sure all the points in your list are about the same length. Eye-tracking research shows that symmetrical content holds readers’ attention longer. Consistency is key for readability.\nFor example:\nKeep bullet points symmetrical Make sure they’re simple to read NOT\nKeep bullet points symmetrical When writing bullet points, make sure they’re simple and easy to read — this makes it easier for readers to follow 2. Simplify Your Idea Powerful bullet points get right to the point with no added fluff. Remove any extra words and include only the most important ideas and phrases.\nFor example:\nEat oranges for extra vitamin C NOT\nYou can eat oranges to increase the amount of vitamin C in your body 3. Make Them Mini-Headlines Think of writing your bulleted lists the way you would write a catchy headline. Include the most important information first, then add details afterwards. Use power words to add strength to your bullet points.\nFor example:\nAccess power words instantly NOT\nGet access to all the best words to use right away 4. Begin With Verbs Verbs pull readers in instantly by offering the most informative words first. Leading with verbs creates more impactful sentences since they emphasize action.\nFor example:\nBegin bullet points with a verb NOT\nTo start a bullet point, use a verb 5. Incorporate Keywords Emphasizing your keywords helps readers find information faster and increases your article’s chances of ranking as a featured snippet. Better SEO leads to more traffic for your article and website.\nFor example:\nInclude exact key phrases NOT\nInclude important phrases that are key to the content 5 Vital Tips for Using Bullet Points Effectively Follow these tips to make your bullet points the best they can be:\nWrite in short phrases: Effective bullet points are short and to the point. Remove transition words: Bullet points don’t need full sentences. Words like “next” or “additionally” are unnecessary. Emphasize the first few words: For longer bullets, summarize the main point in the first few words. Don’t use too many bullets: A long wall of bullets is as bad as no bullets. Avoid sub-bullets or nested bullets to keep text clear. Ensure continuity: Make sure your introductory sentence flows seamlessly into your bullet points. Write in short phrases:\nRemove transition words:\nEmphasize the first few words:\nDon’t use too many bullets:\nEnsure continuity:\nFor example:\nCorrect: Amara’s favorite fruits are:\nCorrect:\nApples Bananas Mangoes Incorrect: Amara’s favorite fruits are:\nIncorrect:\nShe likes apples She likes to eat bananas Mango Punctuation and Grammar in Bulleted Lists Poor punctuation can cost you credibility. Follow these style guidelines to ensure accuracy:\nCapitalization The first word of each bullet point usually starts with a capital letter. This is standard in business writing and online content.\nSentences Maintain the same format for all bullet points in a list. If your bullet point is just a phrase or sentence fragment, don’t add a period at the end.\nPeriods If your bullet point is a complete sentence, finish it with a period. If it’s a fragment or phrase, it doesn’t need a period.\nColons When introducing a bulleted list, end the introductory phrase with a colon, not a dash or semicolon.\n5 Great Examples of Bullet Points to Learn From Want to see excellent examples of bullet points across various platforms? Here are five examples to get you started:\n1. Bullet List Example by APA Style Guide This list introduces the most important information with a single word or phrase.\n2. Bulleted List Example from the CoSchedule Blog This list uses a bold introductory phrase, making it easy for readers to find the bullet points quickly. Each point is short and starts with a capital letter.\n3. Bulleted List Example by ConvertKit Here, the first word of each point is bolded to emphasize the most important information first. The sentence that follows adds clarity and detail.\n4. Bulleted List Example by Zapier This bullet list is unique because it’s written in the first person. It uses symmetry, verbs, and short phrases to make points clear quickly.\n5. Bulleted List Example by Ahrefs This list replaces long sentences with short, sweet points, keeping readers engaged with concise information.\nTips for Using Bullet Points on Social Media Incorporate bullet points in long-form social media content with these strategies:\nUse Emojis Instead of Icons Emojis convey more meaning than generic icons and can stop the scroll. Use them in long-form posts like Twitter threads or LinkedIn text posts.\nHighlight Important Details Use bullet points to break down information into digestible chunks that stand out to your audience.\nBe Consistent Consistency in punctuation, formatting, and grammar is crucial for readability and professionalism.\nCreating Persuasive Bullet Points with AI AI can help you write powerful bullet points.

<h2 id="numbered-lists-vs-bulleted-lists">Numbered Lists vs. Bulleted Lists<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#numbered-lists-vs-bulleted-lists">#</a></h2>
<p>Generally, there are two forms of lists — numbered lists and bulleted lists. Here are some tips for using each option effectively.</p>
<h3 id="when-numbered-lists-are-better">When Numbered Lists Are Better<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-numbered-lists-are-better">#</a></h3>
<p>A numbered list is introduced with a numerical value. These lists are best used when the order of the items matters, such as steps in a process.</p>
<p>Numbered lists might be used for any of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a top 10 list</li>
<li>Writing a step-by-step guide</li>
<li>Listing hypotheses</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how a numbered list would work in a step-by-step guide for washing a car:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare two buckets of water with a cleaning solution and a spare cloth.</li>
<li>Park your car in an open space where you can reach all sides.</li>
<li>Rinse the car with clean water to remove any loose dirt or mud.</li>
<li>Dip the cloth in the cleaning solution and use it to wipe the car down, from top to bottom.</li>
<li>Rinse the car again with clean water to remove all the cleaning solution.</li>
<li>Wax your car for added shine and luxury.</li>

<p>The benefits of bulleted lists include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing content efficiently: Simplifying content gets your point across faster.</li>
<li>Improving readability: Readers enjoy content more when it is easy to skim and read.</li>
<li>Drawing attention to key information: Readers grasp valuable information more quickly.</li>

<h3 id="1-keep-bullet-points-symmetrical">1. Keep Bullet Points Symmetrical<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-keep-bullet-points-symmetrical">#</a></h3>
<p>Make sure all the points in your list are about the same length. Eye-tracking research shows that symmetrical content holds readers’ attention longer. Consistency is key for readability.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep bullet points symmetrical</li>
<li>Make sure they’re simple to read</li>
</ul>
<p>NOT</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep bullet points symmetrical</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-simplify-your-idea">2. Simplify Your Idea<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-simplify-your-idea">#</a></h3>
<p>Powerful bullet points get right to the point with no added fluff. Remove any extra words and include only the most important ideas and phrases.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="3-make-them-mini-headlines">3. Make Them Mini-Headlines<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-make-them-mini-headlines">#</a></h3>
<p>Think of writing your bulleted lists the way you would write a catchy headline. Include the most important information first, then add details afterwards. Use power words to add strength to your bullet points.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access power words instantly</li>
</ul>
<p>NOT</p>
<ul>
<li>Get access to all the best words to use right away</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these tips to make your bullet points the best they can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write in short phrases: Effective bullet points are short and to the point.</li>
<li>Remove transition words: Bullet points don’t need full sentences. Words like “next” or “additionally” are unnecessary.</li>
<li>Emphasize the first few words: For longer bullets, summarize the main point in the first few words.</li>
<li>Don’t use too many bullets: A long wall of bullets is as bad as no bullets. Avoid sub-bullets or nested bullets to keep text clear.</li>
<li>Ensure continuity: Make sure your introductory sentence flows seamlessly into your bullet points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Write in short phrases:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove transition words:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emphasize the first few words:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Don’t use too many bullets:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ensure continuity:</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Correct: Amara’s favorite fruits are:</p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Bananas</li>
<li>Mangoes</li>
</ul>
<p>Incorrect: Amara’s favorite fruits are:</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>She likes apples</li>
<li>She likes to eat bananas</li>
<li>Mango</li>
</ul>

<p>Poor punctuation can cost you credibility. Follow these style guidelines to ensure accuracy:</p>
<h3 id="capitalization">Capitalization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#capitalization">#</a></h3>

<h3 id="sentences">Sentences<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sentences">#</a></h3>
<p>Maintain the same format for all bullet points in a list. If your bullet point is just a phrase or sentence fragment, don’t add a period at the end.</p>
<h3 id="periods">Periods<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#periods">#</a></h3>
<p>If your bullet point is a complete sentence, finish it with a period. If it’s a fragment or phrase, it doesn’t need a period.</p>
<h3 id="colons">Colons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#colons">#</a></h3>
