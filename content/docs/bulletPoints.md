Bullet points are essential for writing content that grabs attention. Discover why they’re valuable and see examples to help you write your own effective bullet points.

In this age of non-stop online stimulation, capturing and keeping attention is crucial for marketers. Grabbing and holding the attention of your audience can make or break your ability to bring awareness to your brand.

Bullet points offer readers the brevity they want without sacrificing value. To achieve this, your bullet points should be high-impact statements about your content.

In this article, we’ll share ways you can use bullet points to make your content more appealing to readers while keeping their attention. We’ll also highlight an important tool to help you write persuasive bullet points.

## Numbered Lists vs. Bulleted Lists

Generally, there are two forms of lists — numbered lists and bulleted lists. Here are some tips for using each option effectively.

### When Numbered Lists Are Better

A numbered list is introduced with a numerical value. These lists are best used when the order of the items matters, such as steps in a process.

Numbered lists might be used for any of the following reasons:

- Creating a top 10 list
- Writing a step-by-step guide
- Listing hypotheses

Here’s how a numbered list would work in a step-by-step guide for washing a car:

1. Prepare two buckets of water with a cleaning solution and a spare cloth.
2. Park your car in an open space where you can reach all sides.
3. Rinse the car with clean water to remove any loose dirt or mud.
4. Dip the cloth in the cleaning solution and use it to wipe the car down, from top to bottom.
5. Rinse the car again with clean water to remove all the cleaning solution.
6. Wax your car for added shine and luxury.

### When Bulleted Lists Win

We use bullet lists when the order of the points doesn’t matter. These lists begin with a special character, commonly dots.

The benefits of bulleted lists include:

- Sharing content efficiently: Simplifying content gets your point across faster.
- Improving readability: Readers enjoy content more when it is easy to skim and read.
- Drawing attention to key information: Readers grasp valuable information more quickly.

## How to Write Powerful Bullet Points

Writing strong bullet points doesn’t have to be a mystery. Here’s what you need to know to write bulleted lists that keep readers interested:

### 1. Keep Bullet Points Symmetrical

Make sure all the points in your list are about the same length. Eye-tracking research shows that symmetrical content holds readers’ attention longer. Consistency is key for readability.

For example:

- Keep bullet points symmetrical
- Make sure they’re simple to read

NOT

- Keep bullet points symmetrical
- When writing bullet points, make sure they’re simple and easy to read — this makes it easier for readers to follow

### 2. Simplify Your Idea

Powerful bullet points get right to the point with no added fluff. Remove any extra words and include only the most important ideas and phrases.

For example:

- Eat oranges for extra vitamin C

NOT

- You can eat oranges to increase the amount of vitamin C in your body

### 3. Make Them Mini-Headlines

Think of writing your bulleted lists the way you would write a catchy headline. Include the most important information first, then add details afterwards. Use power words to add strength to your bullet points.

For example:

- Access power words instantly

NOT

- Get access to all the best words to use right away

### 4. Begin With Verbs

Verbs pull readers in instantly by offering the most informative words first. Leading with verbs creates more impactful sentences since they emphasize action.

For example:

- Begin bullet points with a verb

NOT

- To start a bullet point, use a verb

### 5. Incorporate Keywords

Emphasizing your keywords helps readers find information faster and increases your article’s chances of ranking as a featured snippet. Better SEO leads to more traffic for your article and website.

For example:

- Include exact key phrases

NOT

- Include important phrases that are key to the content

## 5 Vital Tips for Using Bullet Points Effectively

Follow these tips to make your bullet points the best they can be:

- Write in short phrases: Effective bullet points are short and to the point.
- Remove transition words: Bullet points don’t need full sentences. Words like “next” or “additionally” are unnecessary.
- Emphasize the first few words: For longer bullets, summarize the main point in the first few words.
- Don’t use too many bullets: A long wall of bullets is as bad as no bullets. Avoid sub-bullets or nested bullets to keep text clear.
- Ensure continuity: Make sure your introductory sentence flows seamlessly into your bullet points.

For example:

Correct: Amara’s favorite fruits are:

- Apples
- Bananas
- Mangoes

Incorrect: Amara’s favorite fruits are:

- She likes apples
- She likes to eat bananas
- Mango

## Punctuation and Grammar in Bulleted Lists

Poor punctuation can cost you credibility. Follow these style guidelines to ensure accuracy:

### Capitalization

The first word of each bullet point usually starts with a capital letter. This is standard in business writing and online content.

### Sentences

Maintain the same format for all bullet points in a list. If your bullet point is just a phrase or sentence fragment, don’t add a period at the end.

### Periods

If your bullet point is a complete sentence, finish it with a period. If it’s a fragment or phrase, it doesn’t need a period.

### Colons

When introducing a bulleted list, end the introductory phrase with a colon, not a dash or semicolon.

### 4. Bulleted List Example by Zapier

### 5. Bulleted List Example by Ahrefs

## Tips for Using Bullet Points on Social Media

Incorporate bullet points in long-form social media content with these strategies:

### Use Emojis Instead of Icons

Emojis convey more meaning than generic icons and can stop the scroll. Use them in long-form posts like Twitter threads or LinkedIn text posts.

### Highlight Important Details

Use bullet points to break down information into digestible chunks that stand out to your audience.

### Be Consistent

Consistency in punctuation, formatting, and grammar is crucial for readability and professionalism.
