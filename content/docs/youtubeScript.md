YouTube can be a powerful platform for brands in every industry. The sheer number of users can increase your reach, and the interactive nature of video content makes it easier to forge a connection with your audience.

## How To Write a YouTube Script

Having a script might feel counterproductive to creating an authentic video. But unscripted videos aren’t always as spontaneous as you’d like them to be, and they run the risk of spiraling off on unnecessary tangents. Not to mention, they increase the number of filler words as you scramble to think up the next sentence.

To appear natural and confident in front of the camera (or as a voiceover for animation, explainer video, or other visuals), you need a YouTube script.

### Good YouTube Scripts Follow a Proven Structure:

- The Setup (Act One): Introduce the audience to a problem.
- The Conflict (Act Two): Escalate the problem and create tension.
- The Resolution (Act Three): Provide a solution to the problem.

This storytelling formula is used in novels, films, and videos across various industries because it works. For instance:

- Act One: Your audience wants to learn Spanish but doesn’t know where to start; classes are too expensive and they don’t know any native speakers.
- Act Two: Your audience urgently needs to learn Spanish for an upcoming trip. Without basic knowledge, they might face embarrassing or frustrating situations.
- Act Three: Offer easy ways to start learning Spanish and guide them through the initial steps.

Start by identifying the pain point you want to address and work backward. Ask yourself why this topic is important to your audience, what it means for them if they can’t solve the issue, and how you can help. Then, break down your answers into the three-act structure to start plotting your script.

## What Makes a Good YouTube Video Script?

While following this structure is essential, several elements can make your YouTube video script more compelling. Here’s what goes into a great script:

### 1. The Right Topic

A polished script won’t get views if the topic doesn’t resonate with your audience. Focus on their pain points by understanding their lives, the problems they face, and how your solution can help. Easier said than done? Not necessarily.

Here are some ways to find great video topic ideas:

#### Keyword Research

Use tools like Ahrefs to explore search terms your audience uses. Alternatively, use YouTube’s suggestions by typing a keyword into the search bar and reviewing the results. Google Trends can help determine if these topics are in demand.

#### Survey Your Audience

Ask your audience directly via surveys or social media to see what content they want. You can also interview your best customers to dig deeper into their pain points.

### 2. Engaging Right Until The End

Don’t wing your script. An outline keeps your video on topic and covers all key points. Start with a strong hook, deliver value quickly, and close with a call to action.

According to YouTube, you have less than 15 seconds to grab attention, so the first few seconds should pack a punch. Get straight to the point and hint at what viewers will learn by the end.

### 3. Deliver What You Promise

Your script should deliver on its promises. If you promise to teach viewers how to learn Spanish quickly in three weeks, ensure your content follows through.

- Stick to one key lesson.
- Address a specific pain point.
- Refer back to your research and outline to cover all key points.

### 4. Relaxed and Conversational Tone

Write as you speak to ensure your script sounds natural. Read sentences out loud or pretend you’re talking to a friend when writing your script.

## Do You Always Need a Script for Your YouTube Video?

Whether you need a script depends on the video type. Bullet points may suffice for some videos, but scripts are useful for engaging videos, animations with voiceovers, tutorials, and interviews. Scripts also help repurpose content into blog posts, emails, social media copy, and other formats, maximizing its value and reach.
