Want to break into the market as a copywriter? Here are 10 tips to keep in mind and 6 skills to master if you want to learn copywriting.

Copywriting is one of the oldest marketing methods and is still in use today. A decision to learn copywriting is wise because web copywriting is in high demand. According to LinkedIn, hiring for such digital marketing roles grew by 33% in 2020.

Whether you’re a beginner copywriter or an expert content marketer looking to hone your copywriting skills, this article will help. We’re sharing major copywriting tips for beginners as well as exploring the various job opportunities available to copywriters today.

## What is a Copywriter?

A copywriter specializes in creating persuasive copy for websites, emails, print advertisements, products, and more. “Copy” is text designed to get readers to take a specific action, such as stopping to look at a billboard, buying a product, joining an email list, and so on.

Copywriting differs from content writing in that copywriters often write fewer words while needing to make a quicker or stronger impact. Their words should move the reader from being a passive bystander to engaging with the brand or product.

## How to Start Copywriting with Zero Experience

Everyone starts somewhere, so don’t feel like a copywriting career is outside your reach because you have no experience. However, to start copywriting, you’ll need to be willing to learn — and fast. These are the three keys to becoming a good copywriter:

### 1. Learn About Copywriting

The first step for every new venture is research. A few ways you can learn about copywriting:

- Follow useful copywriting blogs like Copyhackers and Copyblogger
- Read copywriting books to learn copywriting techniques — many copywriters swear by Ann Handley’s book, "Everybody Writes"
- Watch YouTube videos about copywriting — Ashlyn Carter and Alex Cattoni make helpful videos

### 2. Study Successful Copywriters

Reverse-engineering web copy is a clever way to see how copywriting works in practice and learn the skill yourself. Study web pages across a variety of industries. Start with your favorite big corporations: the places you like to eat and shop and the software you use.

Notice why their landing pages work and try to figure out why their product descriptions appeal to you. With the knowledge you’re gaining from copywriting blogs and books, you’ll find it easier to break down great copy and replicate it.

### 3. Practice

Try writing fictional web copy to test your skills! Imagine you’re setting up your own business, for example. Better yet, create a website for your copywriting business as your first project. Build all the necessary pages — the About Us, Services, and sales pages — on your own.

If you’re hesitant to start, try these copywriting exercises:

- Rewrite a famous ad
- Write a landing page for a fictional business
- Come up with three headlines daily
- Write an ad for a recently watched movie
- Rewrite a sales email from your favorite brand
- Write a sales email to a friend promoting your favorite brand of sneakers

## 6 Copywriting Skills You Need to Succeed

To excel in copywriting, you need to develop certain skills. Here are the top six skills essential for effective copywriting:

### 1. Strong Writing

It may seem obvious, but strong writing skills are crucial. Web copywriters typically use fewer words, so you need to write concisely. Your writing should be convincing and articulate complex ideas clearly and briefly, with excellent grammar.

### 2. Customer Insight

As a copywriter, you act as the voice of your clients. You need to understand their businesses, target audience, and unique value propositions. Good listening skills and curiosity will help you create compelling copy that highlights product benefits and addresses customer needs.

### 3. Understanding of Marketing and Sales

The goal of copywriting is to drive sales. You should understand basic sales and marketing concepts, such as sales funnels, to tailor your copy to different stages of the customer journey. Knowing when to inform and when to persuade is key.

### 4. Turning Features into Benefits

Effective copywriting focuses on the audience. Convert product features into benefits that appeal directly to customers. For instance, instead of highlighting a "first-ever band-aid for all skin tones," emphasize "a band-aid that matches your skin." Show how features benefit the customer to capture their attention.

### 5. Versatility

Copywriters must adapt to various voices and styles. Whether you're writing for smartwatches one day and software the next, versatility is essential. You'll also need to acquire new skills, like SEO, as you progress in your career.

### 6. Creativity for Generating Convincing Headlines

Headlines are crucial for capturing attention. You need to be creative and understand what makes a strong headline. Consider using headline generator tools to ease the creative burden and generate effective headlines regularly.

## Types of Copywriting Jobs

Copywriters can pursue various career paths:

- In-house copywriter for a company
- Freelance copywriter

There are numerous copywriting niches to explore. Here are some examples:

### Direct Response Copywriting

Writing copy designed to prompt immediate action from the reader, such as signing up for a free trial.

### Social Media Copywriting

Creating engaging copy with a call-to-action for social media platforms.

### Technical Copywriting

Writing manuals, guides, and product descriptions for technical industries, making complex information accessible.

### Public Relations

Crafting communication to maintain or enhance a brand's image and reputation.

### SEO Copywriting

Writing copy that includes strategic keywords to improve search engine rankings.

### Email Copywriting

Creating persuasive sales copy for email marketing campaigns to drive conversions.

## 10 Practical Tips to Consider When Learning to Write Copy

Here are ten practical tips to help you get started with copywriting:

### 1. Research the Competition

Know your client’s competitors and study their copy. This will enable you to help your client emphasize their unique value proposition.

### 2. Make Room for Voice

Inject personality into your copy. Ask your client about their brand voice or help them figure out one if they haven’t yet.

### 3. Think About Your Target Audience

Write using language your audience understands. Always lead with the benefits of your products or service.

### 4. Storytelling Wins

Narrative copywriting takes readers on a journey and helps them get a wider view of your company and the services you offer.

### 5. Use Emotions, but Don’t Manipulate Your Audience

Fear tactics or positioning your product as “the best” is weak copywriting. Instead, show your audience the benefits they’re missing out on and highlight which demographic your product best serves.

### 6. Choose Words Carefully

Being a great copywriter requires that you show more and tell less. Use visuals, choose language that evokes imagery, and edit ruthlessly to remove unnecessary adjectives and adverbs until you only have words you can’t do without.

### 7. Experiment with Copywriting Formulas

Popular copywriting formulas like Attention-Interest-Desire-Awareness (AIDA) and Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS) can make copywriting easier for you.

### 8. Use Copywriting Templates

Instead of starting with a blank page every time, try using templates that implement proven marketing formulas like AIDA, PAS, and Feature to Benefit. These templates can save you time and help you create effective copy.

### 9. Address the Elephant

If your customer has a brand quirk that might put off potential buyers, address it in your copy. Are they more expensive than competitors? Mention it and show why they charge as much.

### 10. Keep a Swipe File

Copywriting requires merciless editing, so save your darlings in a swipe file for days when you’re low on inspiration. Well-written phrases, hard-to-find statistics, and witty CTAs you loved can all go in your swipe file.
