  "articleBody": "10 Best AI Copywriting Tools for 2024 Looking for the best AI copywriting tools to quickly create high-quality content? We review the top 10 AI copywriters for content marketers and copywriters.\nAs a marketer or entrepreneur, you know that copywriting is essential for driving engagement and conversions. But creating that copy isn’t always easy, especially if you have a busy schedule or you’re not an experienced copywriter.\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore AI copywriting and its benefits. And we’ll also cover some of the best AI copywriting software out there. So, whether you’re looking for a tool to help with your copywriting process or just want to learn more about AI copywriting, read on!\nWhy You Should Use AI Copywriting Tools for Marketing Busy professionals should consider using AI copywriting tools for marketing to increase efficiency and productivity.\nThese tools not only help streamline the content creation process, but also save valuable time by generating high-quality copy quickly. AI copywriting tools can also enhance the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by beating writer’s block and by ensuring consistency in messaging across various platforms.\nThrough leveraging AI technology, marketers can stay competitive in the fast-paced digital landscape and achieve better results with minimal effort.\nBenefits of AI Copywriting Tools Increased Productivity: By streamlining the content creation process, these tools help professionals be more productive in their marketing efforts. With increased efficiency, you can free up time for more pressing tasks. Overcoming Writer’s Block: AI tools help you beat writer’s block by providing suggestions and ideas for content creation that you might not have otherwise thought of. Consistent Messaging: Ensures consistency in messaging across different marketing platforms, maintaining Brand Voice (tone and style). Enhanced Creativity: Inspiration from AI-generated content can spark new ideas and creativity for marketers. For example, if you need a headline for a new long-form blog post, you can ask AI for a list of suggestions for you to draw inspiration from. Competitive Edge: Leveraging AI technology keeps marketers competitive in the digital landscape, leading to better results with minimal effort. How Do AI Copywriting Tools Work? AI copywriting tools (using language models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4) operate based on advanced machine learning algorithms that allow them to generate human-like text. These tools use vast amounts of data to train models on language patterns, syntax, and semantics.\nWhen a user inputs a prompt or a query, the AI analyzes the context and generates text that fits the input criteria. Platforms like Comfy Workspace excel at natural language processing, understanding context, and producing coherent and relevant text outputs. These tools can be used for various purposes, including content creation, email writing, social media posts, and more, offering users a quick and efficient way to generate high-quality content. By leveraging these AI technologies, marketers can streamline their content creation process, enhance creativity, and stay ahead in the competitive digital landscape.\nCommon Use Cases for AI Copywriting Tools Generating Product Descriptions AI copywriting tools can help e-commerce businesses create unique and compelling product descriptions at scale, improving SEO and driving conversion rates. You can use a specialized product description generator or build out your product descriptions using the free-form text editors of AI platforms.\nUsing content repurposing features is especially powerful for generating product descriptions because you can leverage existing content to create high-converting descriptions that really drive sales. For example, you could take an email newsletter or a social media post and tell Comfy Workspace to reformat it into a killer product description.\nCrafting Personalized Email Campaigns AI can generate tailored email content based on user behavior and preferences, increasing engagement and click-through rates. This can be done by inputting customer feedback and using natural language processing to create personalized messages that resonate with your email list.\nIncorporating AI into your email content strategy can greatly benefit your business by improving efficiency, increasing engagement, and ultimately driving conversions.\nEnhancing Social Media Presence AI tools can assist in creating captivating social media posts that resonate with the target audience, boosting brand visibility and engagement. By inputting your followers’ comments and trends, AI can suggest hashtags to use, and even generate content ideas.\nOptimizing Website Content AI copywriting tools can analyze website data to generate optimized content that improves search engine rankings and user experience. Platforms like Comfy Workspace understand the fundamentals of on-page SEO, which results in powerful website content that’s designed to rank on search engines.\nCreating Blog Posts and Articles AI can assist in researching, organizing, and writing blog posts and articles on various topics, saving time and increasing output efficiency. With the ability to scan through thousands of articles and sources, AI can quickly gather information and generate unique content that is well-researched and engaging.\nDeveloping Ad Copy AI tools can help marketers generate effective ad copy that drives conversions and maximizes ROI across different advertising platforms. These platforms can assist you from start to finish in creating a new ad campaign. We recommend starting off with generating ideas for ad campaigns and then using ad copy templates to create the actual copy you’ll use.\nImproving Content Localization AI copywriting tools can facilitate the translation and adaptation of content into multiple languages, ensuring consistency and relevance across global markets. The best AI copywriting tools on the market will support multilingual content creation and translation. Comfy Workspace has support for 30+ languages and can easily translate content from one language to another.\nThe 10 Best AI Copywriting Tools Not all AI writers are made equal and some generate more high-quality outputs than the others. Here are 10 of the best AI copywriting tools you can try:\n1. Comfy Workspace Comfy Workspace is the leading AI copywriting tool with thousands of 5-star reviews.\nComfy Workspace has more than 100,000 users ranging from enterprise marketing teams and solo entrepreneurs to small business owners and freelance bloggers.\nFeatures Comfy Workspace’s features include:\nAdd reams of company knowledge to Comfy Workspace — company information, brand position, product information, style guides, customer research, competitive analysis, and more — and access it all in every prompt. We use enterprise-grade security and privacy measures backed by SOC 2 and GDPR compliance. The Team Acceleration feature aims to streamline enterprise marketing by enhancing project management, improving content production, reducing miscommunications, and creating campaigns effortlessly; all within the platform for a more efficient workflow. Comfy Workspace’s integrated metrics suite not only tracks campaign progress but also provides performance analytics, allowing you to view real-time content performance, receive evidence-based recommendations for improvements, automate changes with a click, and identify trends for future strategy. Access to more than 50+ templates to help you write everything from ad copy, taglines, sentences and website copy to email subject lines, blog posts, and social media posts. Pros Of course, saving time is a big benefit of any decent AI writing tool. But Comfy Workspace’s other advantages are:\nAlways on-brand. Rest assured that all the content Comfy Workspace helps create is infused with the most up-to-date intel and branding about your business. Campaign collaborations. Your entire team can cross-manage full, multi-asset campaigns from the same spot. Interoperability. Comfy Workspace is powered by a wide variety of LLMs and model providers, so you never have to worry about unexpected service outages or wonky changes to privacy or accuracy. Flexibility. Unlike alternatives that only have templates, you can create personalized recipes and commands to create whatever kind of copy and content you need in a way that works for you. Comfy Workspace Art. Need a stock photo but your image provider isn’t serving what you need? Comfy Workspace can whip up new images based on what you and your imagination feed it. Integrations. Comfy Workspace integrates with tools like Webflow, Zapier, Google Sheets + Docs, and Surfer SEO to maintain high content quality while also simplifying your processes. Cons Some things to be aware of when starting with Comfy Workspace are that:\nThere is a learning curve. However, Comfy Workspace Jumpstart, as well as the Facebook group, YouTube channel, and webinars can help you understand how to get the best outputs possible from Comfy Workspace. No free and unlimited plans. However, you do get a free 7-day trial when you sign up and can scale your plan up depending on how many words you need each month. Price Comfy Workspace offers several flexible pricing plans starting at just $5 per month. Check out our pricing page for more details.\n2. CopyAI CopyAI is another popular AI writer with more than 500,000 users and many copywriting tools available.\nFeatures CopyAI’s functionality includes:\n90+ writing tools for different types of copy and content, which is far more than what most alternative tools have. Input a website URL. Generate a project brief that covers the purpose, unique aspects, target audiences, and other details of a product or service in one click. Generate unique copy based on that brief in one click. The Editor, which makes it possible to write long-form copy such as landing pages without leaving CopyAI. Pros The pros of CopyAI are:\nEase of use. The user interface is simple, meaning that you can start generating quality content and copy quickly. Natural language. Unlike many similar tools that basically generate gibberish, CopyAI consistently generates coherent sentences. Affordability. If you have limited content needs, the free plan may work for you, otherwise, you can get unlimited credits for just $49 monthly. Cons Some disadvantages of CopyAI are that:\nMany of the outputs are surface-level. While it imitates natural language well, compared to Comfy Workspace, there are fewer ways to provide the additional context needed to dive deep into a topic. No integrations currently. Therefore, it may not save time and simplify your process as much as it could. Not great at long-form content like blog posts. Price CopyAI has a free plan so that you can get a feel for how the tool works before you upgrade. The Pro plan starts at $49 per month and will get you unlimited credits and projects. There’s also an enterprise plan for large teams that need collaboration features.\n3. Closers Copy Closers Copy, which owns its own AI instead of using the standard GPT-3/OpenAI, has grown in popularity due to the quality of its outputs.\nFeatures Closers Copy features include:\nCustom AI, workflows, and library of frameworks and workflows from the Closers Copy community to create super-targeted content and save time. Three artificial intelligence models for selling, blogging, and storytelling so that your outputs have the style and tone. A built-in thesaurus and search engine optimization features, allowing you to use fewer tools. Pros The advantages of this tool are:\nFlexibility. Instead of being solely template-based, you can feed your own sample data to the AI for more custom, targeted outputs. You can also save that sample data as a reusable framework. Understands 120+ languages. Closers Copy makes the benefits of artificial intelligence widely accessible. Lifetime deal. This is one of relatively few (good) AI copywriting tools that offer lifetime deals. Cons As far as disadvantages, Closers Copy users have mentioned:\nThe learning curve. With so many features, it takes a while to get comfortable with the tool. Limited tutorials. While more are being added, users want more context and training on how to get the best out of this tool. Lack of a built-in plagiarism checker. In contrast, you can use Copyscape credits directly in Comfy Workspace. Price Pricing starts at $29.99 per month and ranges up to $79.99 per month for the most extensive plan. Lifetime deals currently start at $267 and can be broken up into several payments.\n4. Copysmith Copysmith is another popular option and positions itself specifically as being for e-commerce teams and agencies.\nFeatures Copysmith’s functionality includes:\nA campaign builder that allows users to build entire campaigns in just a few clicks. Bulk content generation and product description generation to get more done in less time. Collaboration features including a workflow queue for managing your feedback and approval process. Integrations with Frase, Google Ads, Shopify, Chrome, Google Docs, Zapier, WooCommerce, and Word. Pros The advantages of using Copysmith are:\nTime-savings. Bulk generation is a feature that not many AI writing tools have implemented yet so it can be a huge time-saver. SEO training. This artificial intelligence is trained not just on language models but also on SEO best practices and growth marketing, which means more optimized copy and content with less manual work. Cons Some disadvantages of Copysmith are:\nFewer templates than alternatives. That means less flexibility as far as what kinds of copy and content you can create. Lack of support. Some users have mentioned that it’s difficult to get replies to questions and concerns from the support team. Not well-suited for longer copy and content. Although it does have blog templates, for example, users have noted that it’s better for short-form writing than long-form sales and marketing copy like landing pages. Price Pricing starts at an affordable $19 per month for 50 credits. The Professional plan, which includes 400 credits, is $59, and pricing for the Enterprise plan is available upon request.\n5. Rytr Rytr has over 850,000 users including marketers and marketing agencies, content creation professionals, sales development representatives, and more.\nFeatures Features of Rytr include:\n30+ use cases and templates, custom use cases, as well as 20+ tones of voice. An SEO analyzer to find keywords, create content briefs, and make sure your copy is optimized. A browser extension that can be used in Gmail, Slack, Messenger, Word, WordPress, and more (plus an API to integrate apps of your choice). Pros The pros of Rytr are:\nSimplicity. Because it’s not as full-featured as alternatives, Rytr has less of a learning curve. Convenience. You can generate AI content and copy almost anywhere thanks to the mobile-friendly site and Chrome extension. Affordability. Not only is there a free plan but Rytr paid plans start at just $9 per month. Cons Some cons of Rytr are:\nCharacter limits. Many users have mentioned that credits for the limited plans run out quickly. Some low-quality outputs. Rytr sometimes struggles with naturalness and relevance. And, in contrast to Comfy Workspace, there’s no way to prevent those low-quality outputs from being counted against your character limits. Customer support. Some users have had difficulty getting issues resolved with the support team. Price Rytr has a free plan, as well as paid plans for $9 and $29 respectively.\n6. Writesonic Writesonic offers more than 80 templates ranging from long-form blog posts to landing page optimizations. Perhaps the most unique feature of this AI copywriting tool is the option to choose between four different word qualities: economy, average, good, and premium.\nFeatures Writesonic features include:\nChatsonic, an AI-enabled chatbot that can generate AI images and copy similar to ChatGPT. Integration with Surfer SEO to help you generate SEO-friendly content without the need for additional tools. A bulk upload tool that lets you create more than 1,000 pieces of copy in one click, making content generation a breeze. Pros The advantages of Writesonic include:\nFriendly interface and walkthrough style lets you jump right in and start using its features. Writes in 24 languages. You can use Writesonic to generate copy for your audience whether they speak English, Spanish, French, or another of the platform’s 24 supported languages. Cons Some disadvantages to Writesonic include:\nLimited self-help. The Writesonic Academy is fairly basic and doesn’t cover how to use all of the platform’s features. Weak copy. While using Writesonic set to Premium quality, we still encountered passive voice and repetitive sentences which can reduce the effectiveness of your copy. No mix-and-match word quality. We tried to use our premium quality credits to write an article headline and match it with an economy-quality intro, but Writesonic wouldn’t let us. Price Writesonic pricing starts at $12.67 a month for 190,000 words, one user, and economy quality (billed annually). Upgrading to premium quality words costs the same price per month but limits you to 19,000 words. A limited free trial and custom plans for teams are also available.\n7. Anyword If you ever wanted to gauge the effectiveness of your copy before you hit publish, Anyword can help. It uses analytics to predict a performance score for any type of copy including social posts and articles.\nFeatures Anyword features include:\nPredictive analysis to help you choose the most impactful AI copy based on your audience’s demographics. Customer persona creation to help Anyword’s predictive analytics match its scores with your ideal audience or customers. 100+ AI writing tools and 200+ data-based copywriting tools are available, including data-driven tools that allow you to choose copy that’s most appealing to your intended audience. Pros The pros of Anyword are:\nData-driven editor. Anyword scores its AI-generated copy based on a combination of analytics and audience demographics. Headline performance scores. Anyword’s AI headline copy scores mean you can take those headline analysis tools out of your kit for good. Cons Some cons of Anyword are:\nNo built-in SEO tools. If you want to optimize your Anyword copy, you’ll need to use another tool to research and identify your target keywords. Real-time analytics requires a pricier plan. There’s no way to see whether the copy you write in the editor will perform well unless you upgrade to the Data-Driven plan. Price Plans for Anyword start at $24 a month for 20,000 word credits and go up to $333 a month for unlimited word credits (billed annually). You can also sign up for a free 7-day trial or 5,000 free credits, whichever option ends first.\n8. Wordtune Almost like a combo of Grammarly and an AI copywriting tool, Wordtune’s editor helps you put the finishing touches on your copy by suggesting improvements, allowing you to change the tone, and rewriting your copy altogether.\nFeatures Wordtune’s main features include:\nChrome extension allows you to get AI copy help anywhere you need it, whenever you need it. Multiple integrations, including Google Docs, Gmail, Twitter, Slack, and Microsoft Word. Wordtune Summarizer allows you to input text and receive an AI-generated summary. Pros Some advantages to Wordtune include:\nSummarizer allows multiple formats. You can upload a PDF, paste a link, or copy and paste the full text to get a TL;DR and save time while researching, reading the news, or taking notes. Editor’s Notes improve word choice. Wordtune helps you reduce repeat words and also suggests potentially more powerful alternatives to energize your copy. Cons A few downsides to Wordtune include:\nEditor still required. Wordtune’s grammatical suggestions don’t dive as deep as your editor might, so you’ll likely still need to run your copy by your resident grammar nerd. Small feature set. Wordtune focuses on its AI rewriting and summary tools, so you won’t get as much help ideating headlines, ad copy, or outlines. Free plan is extremely limited. With 10 rewrites per day, Wordtune’s free plan is too limited a tool to lean on as a serious copywriter. Price The Premium Wordtune plan starts at $9.99 a month for unlimited rewrites if you choose to pay annually.\n9. Writecream For the copywriter who needs a creative edge when it comes to sprucing up cold emails and messages, Writecream offers a unique set of icebreaker tools. Use it to write personalized LinkedIn messages, outreach requests, and even audio icebreakers.\nFeatures Some perks to using Writecream include:\nAssign AI copywriting tasks to ChatGenie and generate copy for Facebook ads, blog posts, and more. Multiple unique tools, including cold emails, angel investment pitches, and human-sounding voiceovers. Writecream comes with browser extensions for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. Pros Writecream comes with the following advantages:\nPlagiarism checker included. No need to worry about plagiarized content, you can double-check your copy’s integrity right in the Writecream dashboard. Supports 75+ languages. That includes AI copywriting in Finnish, Dari, Somali, Urdu, and Welsh. Writecream is one of the few AI copywriting tools that supports this many languages. Cons Downsides to Writecream include:\nLimits on character count and credits. Unless you spring for the unlimited plan, you’re fairly restricted when it comes to word count and credits with Writecream’s free and Standard plans. Voiceovers sound robotic. We found the voiceovers sounded robotic here and there which may be a deal-breaker for podcast or YouTube creators. Price Writecream offers many of its tools for free, or you can upgrade to use its premium features starting at $29 a month. That includes unlimited credits (the free plan comes with 20 credits) and unlimited words each month.\n10. Smart Copy (Unbounce) Part of Unbounce’s conversion intelligence toolkit, Smart Copy (previously known as Snazzy.ai) offers more than 45 templates that help you write everything from meta descriptions and social media posts to employee feedback and brand taglines.\nFeatures Smart Copy comes with the following features:\nGrammarly is built-in so you don’t have to worry about whether that comma goes here—or there. Real-time SEO insights score your content based on your provided target keywords to help you rank higher in the Google SERPs. Desktop app available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as a Chrome extension so you can use Smart Copy wherever your work takes place. Pros Smart Copy offers the following advantages:\nIntegrations galore. Use Smart Copy’s desktop-based client to get AI copywriting help within Microsoft Word, Slack, and even Photoshop. Catchy Hook has lots of potential. Need a call to action (CTA) or Twitter thread hook written? Smart Copy’s Catchy Hook tool might be what you need to brainstorm the one-liner that drives engagement. Low starting price. At $15 a month for 200 credits, Smart Copy’s Essential plan is a great place for freelance copywriters to start. Cons Disadvantages to Smart Copy include:\nFree plan credits aren’t available all at once. Instead, Smart Copy doles out 10 credits each week, adding up to 40 credits each month. This makes it difficult to batch create content ahead of time. Projects limit keywords and audience. This pain point mostly applies to the free plan and its single project limit, but if you use the Essentials plan you may still run into trouble if you target more than three sets of keywords or audience groups. Price Unbounce’s Smart Copy starts at $15 a month for 200 credits and three projects. You can also give its free plan a try with 40 credits per month and one project.\nHow to Choose the Right AI Copywriting Tool As you build your arsenal of copywriting tools, you’ll see that not every tool cuts it. Each one you select should meet some basic criteria, and we have a few key features to keep in mind.\nSigns of a Good AI Copywriter Easy to Use Regardless of what tool you’re using, it shouldn’t add more stress to your life. In reviews or when you test the software, be sure that it is responsive and has an intuitive user interface.\nYou don’t want to spend minutes figuring out what icons mean. For software that naturally may have a learning curve, ensure that there are adequate tutorial videos and help files to smooth out the process.\nWorks Across Devices It may not be the best way to live, but the reality is that we’re almost always working.\nSo you need a tool that works on your laptop, desktop computer, tablet, and mobile phone — or on two of those devices at least.\nSeamless Integrations Besides multiple devices, your chosen software shouldn’t be snobby. It should integrate well with other work tools.\nThink browser extensions, app add-ons, and other app integrations.\nCollaboration-Friendly Content marketers often work with a team of writers, whether in-house or freelance.\nA good AI copywriter should allow you to work together with a click or two, whether by allowing you to share documents or assign tasks.\nFlexible Pricing Plans You shouldn’t necessarily be looking for the cheapest option, but you don’t want to break the bank either.\nAnd sometimes, you simply don’t need the full range of features, so flexible plans and pricing are key.\nConclusion Don’t feel like digging through all the tools to find the best match? Don’t worry, we’ve got your back.\nGive Comfy Workspace a try for free! It seems like there’s a new AI copywriting software being released every week.\nBut to enjoy the benefits of AI writing including saved time, streamlined processes, and more conversions, you’ll need a proven tool like Comfy Workspace.\nAvailable in 25+ languages with more than 50 templates, SEO Mode, Recipes, commands, Documents, Grammarly, a plagiarism checker, lots of tutorials, and an active, supportive community, Comfy Workspace is the cream of the crop.\nIf you haven’t already, sign up for your free trial and take it for a spin!

<p>AI copywriting tools (using language models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4) operate based on advanced machine learning algorithms that allow them to generate human-like text. These tools use vast amounts of data to train models on language patterns, syntax, and semantics.</p>
<p>When a user inputs a prompt or a query, the AI analyzes the context and generates text that fits the input criteria. Platforms like Comfy Workspace excel at natural language processing, understanding context, and producing coherent and relevant text outputs. These tools can be used for various purposes, including content creation, email writing, social media posts, and more, offering users a quick and efficient way to generate high-quality content. By leveraging these AI technologies, marketers can streamline their content creation process, enhance creativity, and stay ahead in the competitive digital landscape.</p>

<p>AI copywriting tools can help e-commerce businesses create unique and compelling product descriptions at scale, improving SEO and driving conversion rates. You can use a specialized product description generator or build out your product descriptions using the free-form text editors of AI platforms.</p>
<p>Using content repurposing features is especially powerful for generating product descriptions because you can leverage existing content to create high-converting descriptions that really drive sales. For example, you could take an email newsletter or a social media post and tell Comfy Workspace to reformat it into a killer product description.</p>
<h3 id="crafting-personalized-email-campaigns">Crafting Personalized Email Campaigns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#crafting-personalized-email-campaigns">#</a></h3>

<h3 id="2-copyai">2. CopyAI<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-copyai">#</a></h3>
<p>CopyAI is another popular AI writer with more than 500,000 users and many copywriting tools available.</p>
<h4 id="features-1">Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-1">#</a></h4>
<p>CopyAI’s functionality includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>90+ writing tools for different types of copy and content, which is far more than what most alternative tools have.</li>

<li>Generate a project brief that covers the purpose, unique aspects, target audiences, and other details of a product or service in one click.</li>
<li>Generate unique copy based on that brief in one click.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="pros-1">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-1">#</a></h4>
<p>The pros of CopyAI are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of use. The user interface is simple, meaning that you can start generating quality content and copy quickly.</li>
<li>Natural language. Unlike many similar tools that basically generate gibberish, CopyAI consistently generates coherent sentences.</li>
<li>Affordability. If you have limited content needs, the free plan may work for you, otherwise, you can get unlimited credits for just $49 monthly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-1">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons-1">#</a></h4>
<p>Some disadvantages of CopyAI are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of the outputs are surface-level. While it imitates natural language well, compared to Comfy Workspace, there are fewer ways to provide the additional context needed to dive deep into a topic.</li>
<li>No integrations currently. Therefore, it may not save time and simplify your process as much as it could.</li>
<li>Not great at long-form content like blog posts.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-1">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-1">#</a></h4>
<p>CopyAI has a free plan so that you can get a feel for how the tool works before you upgrade. The Pro plan starts at $49 per month and will get you unlimited credits and projects. There’s also an enterprise plan for large teams that need collaboration features.</p>
<h3 id="3-closers-copy">3. Closers Copy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-closers-copy">#</a></h3>
<p>Closers Copy, which owns its own AI instead of using the standard GPT-3/OpenAI, has grown in popularity due to the quality of its outputs.</p>
<h4 id="features-2">Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-2">#</a></h4>
<p>Closers Copy features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom AI, workflows, and library of frameworks and workflows from the Closers Copy community to create super-targeted content and save time.</li>
<li>Three artificial intelligence models for selling, blogging, and storytelling so that your outputs have the style and tone.</li>
<li>A built-in thesaurus and search engine optimization features, allowing you to use fewer tools.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pros-2">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-2">#</a></h4>
<p>The advantages of this tool are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility. Instead of being solely template-based, you can feed your own sample data to the AI for more custom, targeted outputs. You can also save that sample data as a reusable framework.</li>
<li>Understands 120+ languages. Closers Copy makes the benefits of artificial intelligence widely accessible.</li>
<li>Lifetime deal. This is one of relatively few (good) AI copywriting tools that offer lifetime deals.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-2">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons-2">#</a></h4>
<p>As far as disadvantages, Closers Copy users have mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The learning curve. With so many features, it takes a while to get comfortable with the tool.</li>
<li>Limited tutorials. While more are being added, users want more context and training on how to get the best out of this tool.</li>
<li>Lack of a built-in plagiarism checker. In contrast, you can use Copyscape credits directly in Comfy Workspace.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-2">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-2">#</a></h4>
<p>Pricing starts at $29.99 per month and ranges up to $79.99 per month for the most extensive plan. Lifetime deals currently start at $267 and can be broken up into several payments.</p>
<h3 id="4-copysmith">4. Copysmith<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-copysmith">#</a></h3>
<p>Copysmith is another popular option and positions itself specifically as being for e-commerce teams and agencies.</p>
<h4 id="features-3">Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-3">#</a></h4>

<h4 id="pros-3">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-3">#</a></h4>
<p>The advantages of using Copysmith are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-savings. Bulk generation is a feature that not many AI writing tools have implemented yet so it can be a huge time-saver.</li>
<li>SEO training. This artificial intelligence is trained not just on language models but also on SEO best practices and growth marketing, which means more optimized copy and content with less manual work.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-3">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons-3">#</a></h4>
<p>Some disadvantages of Copysmith are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer templates than alternatives. That means less flexibility as far as what kinds of copy and content you can create.</li>
<li>Lack of support. Some users have mentioned that it&rsquo;s difficult to get replies to questions and concerns from the support team.</li>
<li>Not well-suited for longer copy and content. Although it does have blog templates, for example, users have noted that it’s better for short-form writing than long-form sales and marketing copy like landing pages.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-3">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-3">#</a></h4>
<p>Pricing starts at an affordable $19 per month for 50 credits. The Professional plan, which includes 400 credits, is $59, and pricing for the Enterprise plan is available upon request.</p>
<h3 id="5-rytr">5. Rytr<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-rytr">#</a></h3>

<li>An SEO analyzer to find keywords, create content briefs, and make sure your copy is optimized.</li>
<li>A browser extension that can be used in Gmail, Slack, Messenger, Word, WordPress, and more (plus an API to integrate apps of your choice).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pros-4">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-4">#</a></h4>
<p>The pros of Rytr are:</p>
<ul>

<p>Some cons of Rytr are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Character limits. Many users have mentioned that credits for the limited plans run out quickly.</li>
<li>Some low-quality outputs. Rytr sometimes struggles with naturalness and relevance. And, in contrast to Comfy Workspace, there’s no way to prevent those low-quality outputs from being counted against your character limits.</li>
<li>Customer support. Some users have had difficulty getting issues resolved with the support team.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-4">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-4">#</a></h4>
<p>Rytr has a free plan, as well as paid plans for $9 and $29 respectively.</p>

<h4 id="features-5">Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-5">#</a></h4>
<p>Writesonic features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chatsonic, an AI-enabled chatbot that can generate AI images and copy similar to ChatGPT.</li>
<li>Integration with Surfer SEO to help you generate SEO-friendly content without the need for additional tools.</li>
<li>A bulk upload tool that lets you create more than 1,000 pieces of copy in one click, making content generation a breeze.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pros-5">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-5">#</a></h4>
<p>The advantages of Writesonic include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friendly interface and walkthrough style lets you jump right in and start using its features.</li>
<li>Writes in 24 languages. You can use Writesonic to generate copy for your audience whether they speak English, Spanish, French, or another of the platform’s 24 supported languages.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-5">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons-5">#</a></h4>
<p>Some disadvantages to Writesonic include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited self-help. The Writesonic Academy is fairly basic and doesn’t cover how to use all of the platform’s features.</li>
<li>Weak copy. While using Writesonic set to Premium quality, we still encountered passive voice and repetitive sentences which can reduce the effectiveness of your copy.</li>
<li>No mix-and-match word quality. We tried to use our premium quality credits to write an article headline and match it with an economy-quality intro, but Writesonic wouldn’t let us.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-5">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-5">#</a></h4>
<p>Writesonic pricing starts at $12.67 a month for 190,000 words, one user, and economy quality (billed annually). Upgrading to premium quality words costs the same price per month but limits you to 19,000 words. A limited free trial and custom plans for teams are also available.</p>
<h3 id="7-anyword">7. Anyword<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#7-anyword">#</a></h3>
<p>If you ever wanted to gauge the effectiveness of your copy before you hit publish, Anyword can help. It uses analytics to predict a performance score for any type of copy including social posts and articles.</p>
<h4 id="features-6">Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-6">#</a></h4>
<p>Anyword features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predictive analysis to help you choose the most impactful AI copy based on your audience’s demographics.</li>
<li>Customer persona creation to help Anyword’s predictive analytics match its scores with your ideal audience or customers.</li>
<li>100+ AI writing tools and 200+ data-based copywriting tools are available, including data-driven tools that allow you to choose copy that’s most appealing to your intended audience.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pros-6">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-6">#</a></h4>
<p>The pros of Anyword are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data-driven editor. Anyword scores its AI-generated copy based on a combination of analytics and audience demographics.</li>
<li>Headline performance scores. Anyword’s AI headline copy scores mean you can take those headline analysis tools out of your kit for good.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-6">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons-6">#</a></h4>
<p>Some cons of Anyword are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No built-in SEO tools. If you want to optimize your Anyword copy, you’ll need to use another tool to research and identify your target keywords.</li>
<li>Real-time analytics requires a pricier plan. There’s no way to see whether the copy you write in the editor will perform well unless you upgrade to the Data-Driven plan.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-6">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-6">#</a></h4>
<p>Plans for Anyword start at $24 a month for 20,000 word credits and go up to $333 a month for unlimited word credits (billed annually). You can also sign up for a free 7-day trial or 5,000 free credits, whichever option ends first.</p>
<h3 id="8-wordtune">8. Wordtune<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-wordtune">#</a></h3>
<p>Almost like a combo of Grammarly and an AI copywriting tool, Wordtune’s editor helps you put the finishing touches on your copy by suggesting improvements, allowing you to change the tone, and rewriting your copy altogether.</p>
<h4 id="features-7">Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-7">#</a></h4>
<p>Wordtune’s main features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome extension allows you to get AI copy help anywhere you need it, whenever you need it.</li>
<li>Multiple integrations, including Google Docs, Gmail, Twitter, Slack, and Microsoft Word.</li>
<li>Wordtune Summarizer allows you to input text and receive an AI-generated summary.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pros-7">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-7">#</a></h4>
<p>Some advantages to Wordtune include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarizer allows multiple formats. You can upload a PDF, paste a link, or copy and paste the full text to get a TL;DR and save time while researching, reading the news, or taking notes.</li>
<li>Editor’s Notes improve word choice. Wordtune helps you reduce repeat words and also suggests potentially more powerful alternatives to energize your copy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-7">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons-7">#</a></h4>
<p>A few downsides to Wordtune include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor still required. Wordtune’s grammatical suggestions don’t dive as deep as your editor might, so you’ll likely still need to run your copy by your resident grammar nerd.</li>
<li>Small feature set. Wordtune focuses on its AI rewriting and summary tools, so you won’t get as much help ideating headlines, ad copy, or outlines.</li>
<li>Free plan is extremely limited. With 10 rewrites per day, Wordtune’s free plan is too limited a tool to lean on as a serious copywriter.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-7">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-7">#</a></h4>
<p>The Premium Wordtune plan starts at $9.99 a month for unlimited rewrites if you choose to pay annually.</p>
<h3 id="9-writecream">9. Writecream<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#9-writecream">#</a></h3>
<p>For the copywriter who needs a creative edge when it comes to sprucing up cold emails and messages, Writecream offers a unique set of icebreaker tools. Use it to write personalized LinkedIn messages, outreach requests, and even audio icebreakers.</p>
<h4 id="features-8">Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-8">#</a></h4>
<p>Some perks to using Writecream include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign AI copywriting tasks to ChatGenie and generate copy for Facebook ads, blog posts, and more.</li>
<li>Multiple unique tools, including cold emails, angel investment pitches, and human-sounding voiceovers.</li>
<li>Writecream comes with browser extensions for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pros-8">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-8">#</a></h4>
<p>Writecream comes with the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plagiarism checker included. No need to worry about plagiarized content, you can double-check your copy’s integrity right in the Writecream dashboard.</li>
<li>Supports 75+ languages. That includes AI copywriting in Finnish, Dari, Somali, Urdu, and Welsh. Writecream is one of the few AI copywriting tools that supports this many languages.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-8">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons-8">#</a></h4>
<p>Downsides to Writecream include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limits on character count and credits. Unless you spring for the unlimited plan, you’re fairly restricted when it comes to word count and credits with Writecream’s free and Standard plans.</li>
<li>Voiceovers sound robotic. We found the voiceovers sounded robotic here and there which may be a deal-breaker for podcast or YouTube creators.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-8">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-8">#</a></h4>
<p>Writecream offers many of its tools for free, or you can upgrade to use its premium features starting at $29 a month. That includes unlimited credits (the free plan comes with 20 credits) and unlimited words each month.</p>
<h3 id="10-smart-copy-unbounce">10. Smart Copy (Unbounce)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#10-smart-copy-unbounce">#</a></h3>
<p>Part of Unbounce’s conversion intelligence toolkit, Smart Copy (previously known as Snazzy.ai) offers more than 45 templates that help you write everything from meta descriptions and social media posts to employee feedback and brand taglines.</p>
<h4 id="features-9">Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-9">#</a></h4>
<p>Smart Copy comes with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grammarly is built-in so you don’t have to worry about whether that comma goes here—or there.</li>
<li>Real-time SEO insights score your content based on your provided target keywords to help you rank higher in the Google SERPs.</li>
<li>Desktop app available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as a Chrome extension so you can use Smart Copy wherever your work takes place.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pros-9">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-9">#</a></h4>
<p>Smart Copy offers the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrations galore. Use Smart Copy’s desktop-based client to get AI copywriting help within Microsoft Word, Slack, and even Photoshop.</li>
<li>Catchy Hook has lots of potential. Need a call to action (CTA) or Twitter thread hook written? Smart Copy’s Catchy Hook tool might be what you need to brainstorm the one-liner that drives engagement.</li>
<li>Low starting price. At $15 a month for 200 credits, Smart Copy’s Essential plan is a great place for freelance copywriters to start.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-9">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons-9">#</a></h4>
<p>Disadvantages to Smart Copy include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free plan credits aren’t available all at once. Instead, Smart Copy doles out 10 credits each week, adding up to 40 credits each month. This makes it difficult to batch create content ahead of time.</li>
<li>Projects limit keywords and audience. This pain point mostly applies to the free plan and its single project limit, but if you use the Essentials plan you may still run into trouble if you target more than three sets of keywords or audience groups.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="price-9">Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#price-9">#</a></h4>
<p>Unbounce’s Smart Copy starts at $15 a month for 200 credits and three projects. You can also give its free plan a try with 40 credits per month and one project.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-right-ai-copywriting-tool">How to Choose the Right AI Copywriting Tool<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-choose-the-right-ai-copywriting-tool">#</a></h2>
<p>As you build your arsenal of copywriting tools, you&rsquo;ll see that not every tool cuts it. Each one you select should meet some basic criteria, and we have a few key features to keep in mind.</p>
<h3 id="signs-of-a-good-ai-copywriter">Signs of a Good AI Copywriter<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#signs-of-a-good-ai-copywriter">#</a></h3>
<h4 id="easy-to-use">Easy to Use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#easy-to-use">#</a></h4>
<p>Regardless of what tool you’re using, it shouldn’t add more stress to your life. In reviews or when you test the software, be sure that it is responsive and has an intuitive user interface.</p>
<p>You don’t want to spend minutes figuring out what icons mean. For software that naturally may have a learning curve, ensure that there are adequate tutorial videos and help files to smooth out the process.</p>
<h4 id="works-across-devices">Works Across Devices<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#works-across-devices">#</a></h4>
<p>It may not be the best way to live, but the reality is that we’re almost always working.</p>
<p>So you need a tool that works on your laptop, desktop computer, tablet, and mobile phone — or on two of those devices at least.</p>
<h4 id="seamless-integrations">Seamless Integrations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#seamless-integrations">#</a></h4>
<p>Besides multiple devices, your chosen software shouldn’t be snobby. It should integrate well with other work tools.</p>
<p>Think browser extensions, app add-ons, and other app integrations.</p>
<h4 id="collaboration-friendly">Collaboration-Friendly<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#collaboration-friendly">#</a></h4>
<p>Content marketers often work with a team of writers, whether in-house or freelance.</p>
<p>A good AI copywriter should allow you to work together with a click or two, whether by allowing you to share documents or assign tasks.</p>
<h4 id="flexible-pricing-plans">Flexible Pricing Plans<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#flexible-pricing-plans">#</a></h4>
<p>You shouldn’t necessarily be looking for the cheapest option, but you don’t want to break the bank either.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you simply don’t need the full range of features, so flexible plans and pricing are key.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
